# weather-patterns-using-kmeans
Given the data of 1.5 million rows and 13 columns of whether of each minute of San Diego, it tries to find pattern among the data using clustering- an unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm.
Only important features are considered due to large dataset, The values are scaled to give importance to all, and plot of cluster is given.
The optimal value of k was decided using elbow method and confirmed using Scheoulette co-fficient and Calinski-Harabasz score.
Due to high data the plotting of first 100 points was viewable clearly.
